        <h2> Javascript Basics </h2>
    <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.  
        JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons.  
        It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions.
        JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmtic control over them.

          <div class="cyantext"> <strong><u>Variable Declaration</u></strong></div>  Javascript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. 
            All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.  
            These unique names are called identifiers. <div class="purple">var x;</div>
        </li>
        <li><strong><u><div class="cyantext">Variable Assignment</u></strong> </li><div>Assignment operators assign vlues to JavaScript variables-
        our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a vlue to a varaible.
    <div class="purple">varx=10;</div></li>
         <li> <div>Data Types<div/> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <div class = "purple">true</div> or <div class="purple">false;</div> null - <div class="purple">null</div> aka nothing; Number - <div class="purple">42</div> or <div class = "purple">3.14159;</div> String - <div class="purple">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</div> Array - <div class="purple">[1, "Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</div> and Object- <div class="purple">{first_name: 'Jame', last_name: 'Doc}</div>
            ']</li>
            <li><div class="cyantext"> Conditionals </div> When you write code, you want to perform different actiosn for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <div class="purple">if</div> a specifiied condition is true, do this code in our code block; <div class="purple">else if</div> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <div class="purple">else</div> we execute this block of code;
            </li>
            <li><div class="cyantext">Loops </div>  There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well ou run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</li>
    <div class="cyantext"> <li><strong><u>Function</u></strong></li></div> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions.
         As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up.
         Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.
